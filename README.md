# SleepTracker


This is the code to run the classifiers on the preprocessed data. To run, simply run this from the root. If you want to modify any of the models, it is easies to just modify this file as well.

`python3 sleep_classifiers-main/source/analysis/analysis_runner.py`


If you are missing any packages, it is highly recommended to use a python environment to install the required ones. One package I had trouble installing was pdfminer, make sure to try:

`pip install pdfminer.six`


The graphs will be in the output folder, and accuracy metrics will be printed in the terminal.

The paper will be uploaded soon.
